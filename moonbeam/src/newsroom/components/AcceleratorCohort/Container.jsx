            is a smart contract platform for building cross-chain connected
            applications that can access users, assets, and services on any
            chain. By uniting functionality from Ethereum, Cosmos, Polkadot and
            more into a single platform, Moonbeam solves today’s fragmented user
            experience — unlocking true interoperability and paving the way for
            the next generation of applications. The Moonbeam platform uses
            integrated cross-chain messaging to allow developers to create smart
            contracts that access services across many remote blockchains. This
            approach, plus Moonbeam’s developer-friendly EVM platform, vast tool
            support, and modern Substrate architecture, creates the ideal
            development environment for building connected applications.
